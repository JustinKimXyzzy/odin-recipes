    <h2>Description</h2>

    This is a fish pop recipe as seen on
    <a href="https://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&issue=275">neopets.com</a>.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One handsaw</li>
        <li>One whittling knife</li>
        <li>One piece of sandpaper (rough)</li>
        <li>One net</li>
        <li>Four Meepits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit your local hardware store or Pirate Plunder outlet.</li>
        <li>Purchase any tools listed above that you didn't already have in your basement.</li>
        <li>Hop on a boat to Mystery Island.</li>
        <li>Don't rock the boat.</li>
        <li>Upon arriving at Mystery Island, wander the jungles until you find a rubber tree. There's one in there somewhere.</li>
        <li>Chop down said rubber tree.</li>
        <li>Whittle the tree down to one stick, exactly 230 mm long and 5 mm in diameter.</li>
        <li>Sand said stick so as not to give the fish (or the eventual consumer of the fish) any splinters.</li>
        <li>Store the stick in a place where it won't get stolen, like your pocket or something. We'll come back to it later.</li>
        <li>Wander lost in the jungle for a few days until you come across some hungry natives.</li>
        <li>RUN!</li>
        <li>Eventually make your way to the shores, where hungry natives dare not tread.</li>
        <li>Use the net to go fishing.</li>
        <li>Use the fishing pole you just caught in the net to actually catch a fish.</li>
        <li>Retrieve the stick. Hopefully you kept it in your pocket.</li>
        <li>Put the stick in your right hand.</li>
        <li>Put the fish in your left hand.</li>
        <li>If you are left-handed, switch the stick and the fish. This step is optional.</li>
        <li>Bring your hands together.</li>
    </ol>

    Congratulations! Now you have a fish on a stick, otherwise known as a Fish Pop! Please remember: when making a Fish Pop, get a parent's permission first!
